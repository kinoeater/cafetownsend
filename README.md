### Automating an Angular Web Page by in Page Object and Cucumber hybrid Framework by the help of ngWebDriver


## CAFETOWNSEND WEB APPLICATION TESTS:

## I. Introduction

This document mainly serves as the plan for testing all software artifacts as well as the reporting of test results. 

## II. Automation Framework 

### Why " NGWebDriver " but not Protractor? 

At first I was thinking to automate the test cases by using protractor. Although I had some experience on that tool (there is a small project on my github) and it is a good fit for angular apps, I also want to benefit from page objects metodology and  Cucumber framework. That was the point I came up to use NGWebDriver. NGWebDriver is a small open source library of WebDriver locators created by " Paul Hammant "  and more for AngularJS (v1.x) and Angular (v2.x +), for Java.  It works with Firefox, Chrome and all the other Selenium-WebDriver browsers.

#### Dowside of using NGWebDriver:
Unfortunately it is not a magic tool that make QA people happy with angular app testing. Sometime it has causing syncronisation issues. 

### Why " Cucumber" and "Page Objects"? 
By using NGWebDriver library we can handle angular application easily and create page objects with ByAngular locator helper. Another thing  page objects design pattern helps us to enhance test maintenance and reduces code duplication. Maybe the best part of this framework is using gherkin language to create easily readible test cases within the automation. They are are also reusable and easy to edit. Moreover tomorrow if we want to add more tests it very easy, we can pick proper methods  from the base page then stick with the step definitions of the gherkin files.

#### Cucumber Framework
You can choose firefox or chrome at the gherkin level. You do not need to bother with updating the browser drivers, because Bonigarciaâ€™s webdriver manager will easily handle it.  If you want to use different browsers like IE, code can also be modified.
Page Object page has its specific web elements in it and Base Page has some specific easy to use methods. More methods can be added if required. It is like a toolbox of the framework, use the gadgets, add new gadgets when you want.

 ### Scenario: Successfully creates a new user then deletes it  
    Given User should be at home page
      And User clicks on the Create button
      And User should be in new user page
      And User enters following details for new user
      
      | First_name | Last_name  | Start_date | Email               | 
      | Alfred     | Pennyworth | 1933-03-14 | Pennyworth@dark.com | 
      
     When User clicks on the Add button
     Then User should see "Alfred Pennyworth" in the employees list
      And User deletes "Alfred Pennyworth"   
     
     # This one deletes newly added employee, so same credentials can be used next time 
     
     And User logs out
     

#### Running the Tests
##### 1. By directly using runner class on IDE
###### Prerequisites
*Install Java and Maven to your machine.
*Install an IDE of your choice, Eclipse or Intellij.
*Install cucumber, gherkin and Test NG plugins to your IDE.


a) You should open / choose one of the runner classes under /check_24_Framework/src/test/java/runners

b) Then you should right click on the page or on the class,

c) Then you should click on TestNG option.

##### 2. By using "mvn test" command on CLI

###### Prerequisites
*Install Java and Maven to your machine.

a) You go to root directory of the maven project from command line (CMD / terminal) 

b) Then type followings

mvn test

c) Then hit enter

### What about reporting?

I used Cucumber Extent Report as reporting tool.
After each test run latest test report can be seen with "report.html" name under /output directory.
Report can be opened simply double clicking on the item.


## III. Manual Test Cases 
Black box manual test cases that will run on the code. Rather creating all of the test cases I wrote down the the test cases for login and create new user functionalities.

The URL: http://cafetownsend-angular-rails.herokuapp.com

### Login functionality tests:

a) Verify that user can successfully login with correct credentials.

b) Verify that user cannot login with incorrect user name.

c) Verify that user cannot login with incorrect password.

d) Verify that user cannot login with empty email

e) Verify that user cannot login with empty password

f) Verify that user cannot login with empty email and empty password

### Create new employee functionality tests:
a)	Verify that user can successfully creates a new user by entering whole credentials correctly, then deletes newly created user entry.

## Gherkin format:

  ### Scenario: Successfully creates a new user then deletes it  
    Given User should be at home page
      And User clicks on the Create button
      And User should be in new user page
      And User enters following details for new user
      
      | First_name | Last_name  | Start_date | Email               | 
      | Alfred     | Pennyworth | 1933-03-14 | Pennyworth@dark.com | 
      
     When User clicks on the Add button
     Then User should see "Alfred Pennyworth" in the employees list
      And User deletes "Alfred Pennyworth"   
     
     # This one deletes newly added employee, so same credentials can be used next time 
     
     And User logs out
     
   
b) Verify that User leaves the first name area empty, then cannot create the new user entry.

c) Verify that User leaves the last name area empty, then cannot create the new user entry.

d) Verify that User leaves the start date area empty, then cannot create the new user entry.

d) Verify that User leaves the email area empty or enters email without ' @ ' sign, then cannot create the new user entry.

e) Verify that User enters whole credentials correctly, then hits "enter key" on keyboard instead of using Add button, then successfully creates a new user.

f) Verify that User enters incorrect date format, then presented with an alert and cannot create the new user entry.
